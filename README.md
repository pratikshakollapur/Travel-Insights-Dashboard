✈️ My Power BI Project – Travel Insights Dashboard
I'm excited to share my interactive dashboard project – built independently using Power BI , PostgreSQL – to explore patterns in travel bookings, customer behavior, and revenue trends.

🔍 Project Highlights:
📊 Dashboard Overview
 • 📅 Total Bookings by Month (trend analysis across seasons)
 • 📍 Top Destinations by Booking Volume
 • 🧳 Booking Breakdown by Channel, Travel Type & Age Group
 • 💰 KPIs: Total Revenue (₹7.18M), Bookings (125K), Avg Trip Duration (6.26 Days)
 • 🎯 Slicers for dynamic filtering by Age Group, Channel & Travel Type

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
• 🐘 PostgreSQL – for importing, cleaning & querying raw travel data
 • 📈 Power BI – for DAX, KPIs, and designing interactive visuals

💡 Key Insights :
• 🏆 Agra, Delhi & Kerala are top travel destinations
 • 📱 Majority bookings made via Website
 • 👨‍👩‍👧 Family & Business travelers dominate the customer base
 • 🎯 Travelers aged 36-50 are most frequent bookers

📈 This self-driven project helped me practice real-world BI workflows – from SQL querying to visual storytelling – while using AI as a productivity booster for smart insights.
